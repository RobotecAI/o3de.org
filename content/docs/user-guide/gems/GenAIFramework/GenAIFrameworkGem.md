---

The Gen AI Framework Gem is meant for O3DE Gems developers, and it is expected to be a dependency of future gems such as AI characters, assistants, and scene generators. Unlike these future gems, its value does not strictly depend on current capabilities of AI models, as it is meant as a tool to explore their limits and is meant to be built in a flexible way, benefiting from improvements in these capabilities over years.
