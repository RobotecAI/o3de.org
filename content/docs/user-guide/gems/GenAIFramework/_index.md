The Generative AI Framework Gem provides a framework for creating and using Generative AI models in Open 3D Engine. Generative AI can be used to help with scene generation, character control and more.  

In this documentation you can learn how to use the main 3 part of the Generative AI Framework.  

1. **GenAIFrameworkGem** - The main Gem that provides the framework for creating and using Generative AI models in Open 3D Engine.
2. **AI Vendor Gems** - The vendor Gems that allow for communication with specific AI services, such as AWS Bedrock.
3. **Feature Gems** - The Gems that use the GenAIFramework to provide specific features, such as Scene Generation, Character Control, and more.
